# OCR-KNN-EasyOCR-
In this repository I have written a code for optical character recognition. I have wrote 2 different code for OCR. One with a library EasyOCR and another using KNN. KNN does not have any model and needs a lot to of time to detect characters in the image while EasyOCR does it in very less time.
